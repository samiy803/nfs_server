DESCRIPTION

    Procedure READDIR retrieves a variable number of entries,
    in sequence, from a directory and returns the name and
    file identifier for each, with information to allow the
    client to request additional directory entries in a
    subsequent READDIR request. On entry, the arguments in
    READDIR3args are:

    dir
        The file handle for the directory to be read.

    cookie
        This should be set to 0 in the first request to read
        the directory. On subsequent requests, it should be a
        cookie as returned by the server.
    cookieverf
        This should be set to 0 in the first request to read
        the directory. On subsequent requests, it should be a
        cookieverf as returned by the server. The cookieverf
        must match that returned by the READDIR in which the
        cookie was acquired.

    count
        The maximum size of the READDIR3resok structure, in
        bytes.  The size must include all XDR overhead. The
        server is free to return less than count bytes of
        data.

    On successful return, READDIR3res.status is NFS3_OK and
    READDIR3res.resok contains:

    dir_attributes
        The attributes of the directory, dir.

    cookieverf
        The cookie verifier.

    reply
        The directory list:

        entries
        Zero or more directory (entry3) entries.

        eof
        TRUE if the last member of reply.entries is the last
        entry in the directory or the list reply.entries is
        empty and the cookie corresponded to the end of the
        directory. If FALSE, there may be more entries to
        read.

    Otherwise, READDIR3res.status contains the error on
    failure and READDIR3res.resfail contains the following:

    dir_attributes
        The attributes of the directory, dir.

IMPLEMENTATION

    In the NFS version 2 protocol, each directory entry
    returned included a cookie identifying a point in the
    directory. By including this cookie in a subsequent
    READDIR, the client could resume the directory read at any
    point in the directory.  One problem with this scheme was
    that there was no easy way for a server to verify that a
    cookie was valid. If two READDIRs were separated by one or
    more operations that changed the directory in some way
    (for example, reordering or compressing it), it was
    possible that the second READDIR could miss entries, or
    process entries more than once. If the cookie was no
    longer usable, for example, pointing into the middle of a
    directory entry, the server would have to either round the
    cookie down to the cookie of the previous entry or round
    it up to the cookie of the next entry in the directory.
    Either way would possibly lead to incorrect results and
    the client would be unaware that any problem existed.

    In the NFS version 3 protocol, each READDIR request
    includes both a cookie and a cookie verifier. For the
    first call, both are set to 0.  The response includes a
    new cookie verifier, with a cookie per entry.  For
    subsequent READDIRs, the client must present both the
    cookie and the corresponding cookie verifier.  If the
    server detects that the cookie is no longer valid, the
    server will reject the READDIR request with the status,
    NFS3ERR_BAD_COOKIE. The client should be careful to
    avoid holding directory entry cookies across operations
    that modify the directory contents, such as REMOVE and
    CREATE.

    One implementation of the cookie-verifier mechanism might
    be for the server to use the modification time of the
    directory. This might be overly restrictive, however. A
    better approach would be to record the time of the last
    directory modification that changed the directory
    organization in a way that would make it impossible to
    reliably interpret a cookie. Servers in which directory
    cookies are always valid are free to use zero as the
    verifier always.

    The server may return fewer than count bytes of
    XDR-encoded entries.  The count specified by the client in
    the request should be greater than or equal to FSINFO
    dtpref.

    Since UNIX clients give a special meaning to the fileid
    value zero, UNIX clients should be careful to map zero
    fileid values to some other value and servers should try
    to avoid sending a zero fileid.
