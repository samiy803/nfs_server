DESCRIPTION

    Procedure MKNOD creates a new special file of the type,
    what.type.  Special files can be device files or named
    pipes.  On entry, the arguments in MKNOD3args are:

    where
        The location of the special file to be created:

        dir
        The file handle for the directory in which the
        special file is to be created.

        name
        The name that is to be associated with the created
        special file. Refer to General comments on filenames
        on page 30.

    what
        A discriminated union identifying the type of the
        special file to be created along with the data and
        attributes appropriate to the type of the special
        file:

        type
        The type of the object to be created.

    When creating a character special file (what.type is
    NF3CHR) or a block special file (what.type is NF3BLK),
    what includes:
    device
        A structure devicedata3 with the following components:

        dev_attributes
        The initial attributes for the special file.

        spec
        The major number stored in device.spec.specdata1 and
        the minor number stored in device.spec.specdata2.

    When creating a socket (what.type is NF3SOCK) or a FIFO
    (what.type is NF3FIFO), what includes:

        pipe_attributes
        The initial attributes for the special file.

    On successful return, MKNOD3res.status is NFS3_OK and
    MKNOD3res.resok contains:

    obj
        The file handle for the newly created special file.

    obj_attributes
        The attributes for the newly created special file.

    dir_wcc
        Weak cache consistency data for the directory,
        where.dir. For a client that requires only the
        post-MKNOD directory attributes, these can be found in
        dir_wcc.after.

    Otherwise, MKNOD3res.status contains the error on failure
    and MKNOD3res.resfail contains the following:

    dir_wcc
        Weak cache consistency data for the directory,
        where.dir. For a client that requires only the
        post-MKNOD directory attributes, these can be found in
        dir_wcc.after. Even though the MKNOD failed, full
        wcc_data is returned to allow the client to determine
        whether the failing MKNOD changed the directory.

IMPLEMENTATION

    Refer to General comments on filenames on page 30.

    Without explicit support for special file type creation in
    the NFS version 2 protocol, fields in the CREATE arguments
    were overloaded to indicate creation of certain types of
    objects.  This overloading is not necessary in the NFS
    version 3 protocol.

    If the server does not support any of the defined types,
    the error, NFS3ERR_NOTSUPP, should be returned. Otherwise,
    if the server does not support the target type or the
    target type is illegal, the error, NFS3ERR_BADTYPE, should
    be returned. Note that NF3REG, NF3DIR, and NF3LNK are
    illegal types for MKNOD. The procedures, CREATE, MKDIR,
    and SYMLINK should be used to create these file types,
    respectively, instead of MKNOD.

ERRORS

    NFS3ERR_IO
    NFS3ERR_ACCES
    NFS3ERR_EXIST
    NFS3ERR_NOTDIR
    NFS3ERR_NOSPC
    NFS3ERR_ROFS
    NFS3ERR_NAMETOOLONG
    NFS3ERR_DQUOT
    NFS3ERR_STALE
    NFS3ERR_BADHANDLE
    NFS3ERR_NOTSUPP
    NFS3ERR_SERVERFAULT
    NFS3ERR_BADTYPE
