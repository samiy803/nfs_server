SYNOPSIS

    LOOKUP3res NFSPROC3_LOOKUP(LOOKUP3args) = 3;

    struct LOOKUP3args {
        diropargs3  what;
    };

    struct LOOKUP3resok {
        nfs_fh3      object;
        post_op_attr obj_attributes;
        post_op_attr dir_attributes;
    };

    struct LOOKUP3resfail {
        post_op_attr dir_attributes;
    };

    union LOOKUP3res switch (nfsstat3 status) {
    case NFS3_OK:
        LOOKUP3resok    resok;
    default:
        LOOKUP3resfail  resfail;
    };

DESCRIPTION

    Procedure LOOKUP searches a directory for a specific name
    and returns the file handle for the corresponding file
    system object. On entry, the arguments in LOOKUP3args
    are:

    what
        Object to look up:

        dir
        The file handle for the directory to search.

        name
        The filename to be searched for. Refer to General
        comments on filenames on page 30.

    On successful return, LOOKUP3res.status is NFS3_OK and
    LOOKUP3res.resok contains:
    object
        The file handle of the object corresponding to
        what.name.

    obj_attributes
        The attributes of the object corresponding to
        what.name.

    dir_attributes
        The post-operation attributes of the directory,
        what.dir.

    Otherwise, LOOKUP3res.status contains the error on failure and
    LOOKUP3res.resfail contains the following:

    dir_attributes
        The post-operation attributes for the directory,
        what.dir.

IMPLEMENTATION

    At first glance, in the case where what.name refers to a
    mount point on the server, two different replies seem
    possible. The server can return either the file handle for
    the underlying directory that is mounted on or the file
    handle of the root of the mounted directory.  This
    ambiguity is simply resolved. A server will not allow a
    LOOKUP operation to cross a mountpoint to the root of a
    different filesystem, even if the filesystem is exported.
    This does not prevent a client from accessing a hierarchy
    of filesystems exported by a server, but the client must
    mount each of the filesystems individually so that the
    mountpoint crossing takes place on the client.  A given
    server implementation may refine these rules given
    capabilities or limitations particular to that
    implementation. Refer to [X/OpenNFS] for a discussion on
    exporting file systems.

    Two filenames are distinguished, as in the NFS version 2
    protocol.  The name, ".", is an alias for the current
    directory and the name, "..", is an alias for the parent
    directory; that is, the directory that includes the
    specified directory as a member. There is no facility for
    dealing with a multiparented directory and the NFS
    protocol assumes a hierarchical organization, organized as
    a single-rooted tree.

    Note that this procedure does not follow symbolic links.
    The client is responsible for all parsing of filenames
    including filenames that are modified by symbolic links
    encountered during the lookup process.
