DESCRIPTION

    Procedure ACCESS determines the access rights that a user,
    as identified by the credentials in the request, has with
    respect to a file system object. The client encodes the
    set of permissions that are to be checked in a bit mask.
    The server checks the permissions encoded in the bit mask.
    A status of NFS3_OK is returned along with a bit mask
    encoded with the permissions that the client is allowed.

    The results of this procedure are necessarily advisory in
    nature.  That is, a return status of NFS3_OK and the
    appropriate bit set in the bit mask does not imply that
    such access will be allowed to the file system object in
    the future, as access rights can be revoked by the server
    at any time.

    On entry, the arguments in ACCESS3args are:

    object
        The file handle for the file system object to which
        access is to be checked.

    access
        A bit mask of access permissions to check.

    The following access permissions may be requested:

        ACCESS3_READ
        Read data from file or read a directory.

        ACCESS3_LOOKUP
        Look up a name in a directory (no meaning for
        non-directory objects).

        ACCESS3_MODIFY
        Rewrite existing file data or modify existing
        directory entries.

        ACCESS3_EXTEND
        Write new data or add directory entries.

        ACCESS3_DELETE
        Delete an existing directory entry.

        ACCESS3_EXECUTE
        Execute file (no meaning for a directory).

    On successful return, ACCESS3res.status is NFS3_OK. The
    server should return a status of NFS3_OK if no errors
    occurred that prevented the server from making the
    required access checks. The results in ACCESS3res.resok
    are:

    obj_attributes
        The post-operation attributes of object.

    access
        A bit mask of access permissions indicating access
        rights for the authentication credentials provided with
        the request.

        Otherwise, ACCESS3res.status contains the error on failure
    and ACCESS3res.resfail contains the following:

    obj_attributes
        The attributes of object - if access to attributes is
        permitted.

IMPLEMENTATION

    In general, it is not sufficient for the client to attempt
    to deduce access permissions by inspecting the uid, gid,
    and mode fields in the file attributes, since the server
    may perform uid or gid mapping or enforce additional
    access control restrictions. It is also possible that the
    NFS version 3 protocol server may not be in the same ID
    space as the NFS version 3 protocol client. In these cases
    (and perhaps others), the NFS version 3 protocol client
    can not reliably perform an access check with only current
    file attributes.

    In the NFS version 2 protocol, the only reliable way to
    determine whether an operation was allowed was to try it
    and see if it succeeded or failed. Using the ACCESS
    procedure in the NFS version 3 protocol, the client can
    ask the server to indicate whether or not one or more
    classes of operations are permitted.  The ACCESS operation
    is provided to allow clients to check before doing a
    series of operations. This is useful in operating systems
    (such as UNIX) where permission checking is done only when
    a file or directory is opened. This procedure is also
    invoked by NFS client access procedure (called possibly
    through access(2)). The intent is to make the behavior of
    opening a remote file more consistent with the behavior of
    opening a local file.

    The information returned by the server in response to an
    ACCESS call is not permanent. It was correct at the exact
    time that the server performed the checks, but not
    necessarily afterwards. The server can revoke access
    permission at any time.

    The NFS version 3 protocol client should use the effective
    credentials of the user to build the authentication
    information in the ACCESS request used to determine access
    rights. It is the effective user and group credentials
    that are used in subsequent read and write operations. See
    the comments in Permission issues on page 98 for more
    information on this topic.
    Many implementations do not directly support the
    ACCESS3_DELETE permission. Operating systems like UNIX
    will ignore the ACCESS3_DELETE bit if set on an access
    request on a non-directory object. In these systems,
    delete permission on a file is determined by the access
    permissions on the directory in which the file resides,
    instead of being determined by the permissions of the file
    itself.  Thus, the bit mask returned for such a request
    will have the ACCESS3_DELETE bit set to 0, indicating that
    the client does not have this permission.
