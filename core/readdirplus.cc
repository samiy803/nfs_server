DESCRIPTION

    Procedure READDIRPLUS retrieves a variable number of
    entries from a file system directory and returns complete
    information about each along with information to allow the
    client to request additional directory entries in a
    subsequent READDIRPLUS.  READDIRPLUS differs from READDIR
    only in the amount of information returned for each
    entry.  In READDIR, each entry returns the filename and
    the fileid.  In READDIRPLUS, each entry returns the name,
    the fileid, attributes (including the fileid), and file
    handle. On entry, the arguments in READDIRPLUS3args are:

    dir
        The file handle for the directory to be read.

    cookie
        This should be set to 0 on the first request to read a
        directory. On subsequent requests, it should be a
        cookie as returned by the server.

    cookieverf
        This should be set to 0 on the first request to read a
        directory. On subsequent requests, it should be a
        cookieverf as returned by the server. The cookieverf
        must match that returned by the READDIRPLUS call in
        which the cookie was acquired.

    dircount
        The maximum number of bytes of directory information
        returned. This number should not include the size of
        the attributes and file handle portions of the result.

    maxcount
        The maximum size of the READDIRPLUS3resok structure, in
        bytes. The size must include all XDR overhead. The
        server is free to return fewer than maxcount bytes of
        data.

    On successful return, READDIRPLUS3res.status is NFS3_OK
    and READDIRPLUS3res.resok contains:

    dir_attributes
        The attributes of the directory, dir.

    cookieverf
        The cookie verifier.

    reply
        The directory list:

        entries
        Zero or more directory (entryplus3) entries.

        eof
        TRUE if the last member of reply.entries is the last
        entry in the directory or the list reply.entries is
        empty and the cookie corresponded to the end of the
        directory. If FALSE, there may be more entries to
        read.

    Otherwise, READDIRPLUS3res.status contains the error on
    failure and READDIRPLUS3res.resfail contains the following:

    dir_attributes
        The attributes of the directory, dir.

IMPLEMENTATION

    Issues that need to be understood for this procedure
    include increased cache flushing activity on the client
    (as new file handles are returned with names which are
    entered into caches) and over-the-wire overhead versus
    expected subsequent LOOKUP elimination. It is thought that
    this procedure may improve performance for directory
    browsing where attributes are always required as on the
    Apple Macintosh operating system and for MS-DOS.

    The dircount and maxcount fields are included as an
    optimization.  Consider a READDIRPLUS call on a UNIX
    operating system implementation for 1048 bytes; the reply
    does not contain many entries because of the overhead due
    to attributes and file handles. An alternative is to issue
    a READDIRPLUS call for 8192 bytes and then only use the
    first 1048 bytes of directory information. However, the
    server doesn't know that all that is needed is 1048 bytes
    of directory information (as would be returned by
    READDIR). It sees the 8192 byte request and issues a
    VOP_READDIR for 8192 bytes. It then steps through all of
    those directory entries, obtaining attributes and file
    handles for each entry.  When it encodes the result, the
    server only encodes until it gets 8192 bytes of results
    which include the attributes and file handles. Thus, it
    has done a larger VOP_READDIR and many more attribute
    fetches than it needed to. The ratio of the directory
    entry size to the size of the attributes plus the size of
    the file handle is usually at least 8 to 1. The server has
    done much more work than it needed to.

    The solution to this problem is for the client to provide
    two counts to the server. The first is the number of bytes
    of directory information that the client really wants,
    dircount.  The second is the maximum number of bytes in
    the result, including the attributes and file handles,
    maxcount. Thus, the server will issue a VOP_READDIR for
    only the number of bytes that the client really wants to
    get, not an inflated number.  This should help to reduce
    the size of VOP_READDIR requests on the server, thus
    reducing the amount of work done there, and to reduce the
    number of VOP_LOOKUP, VOP_GETATTR, and other calls done by
    the server to construct attributes and file handles.
