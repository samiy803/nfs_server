SYNOPSIS

    REMOVE3res NFSPROC3_REMOVE(REMOVE3args) = 12;

    struct REMOVE3args {
        diropargs3  object;
    };

    struct REMOVE3resok {
        wcc_data    dir_wcc;
    };

    struct REMOVE3resfail {
        wcc_data    dir_wcc;
    };

    union REMOVE3res switch (nfsstat3 status) {
    case NFS3_OK:
        REMOVE3resok   resok;
    default:
        REMOVE3resfail resfail;
    };

DESCRIPTION

    Procedure REMOVE removes (deletes) an entry from a
    directory. If the entry in the directory was the last
    reference to the corresponding file system object, the
    object may be destroyed.  On entry, the arguments in
    REMOVE3args are:

    object
        A diropargs3 structure identifying the entry to be
        removed:

    dir
        The file handle for the directory from which the entry
        is to be removed.

    name
        The name of the entry to be removed. Refer to General
        comments on filenames on page 30.

    On successful return, REMOVE3res.status is NFS3_OK and
    REMOVE3res.resok contains:
    dir_wcc
        Weak cache consistency data for the directory,
        object.dir.  For a client that requires only the
        post-REMOVE directory attributes, these can be found in
        dir_wcc.after.

    Otherwise, REMOVE3res.status contains the error on failure
    and REMOVE3res.resfail contains the following:

    dir_wcc
        Weak cache consistency data for the directory,
        object.dir.  For a client that requires only the
        post-REMOVE directory attributes, these can be found in
        dir_wcc.after. Even though the REMOVE failed, full
        wcc_data is returned to allow the client to determine
        whether the failing REMOVE changed the directory.

IMPLEMENTATION

    In general, REMOVE is intended to remove non-directory
    file objects and RMDIR is to be used to remove
    directories.  However, REMOVE can be used to remove
    directories, subject to restrictions imposed by either the
    client or server interfaces.  This had been a source of
    confusion in the NFS version 2 protocol.

    The concept of last reference is server specific. However,
    if the nlink field in the previous attributes of the
    object had the value 1, the client should not rely on
    referring to the object via a file handle. Likewise, the
    client should not rely on the resources (disk space,
    directory entry, and so on.) formerly associated with the
    object becoming immediately available. Thus, if a client
    needs to be able to continue to access a file after using
    REMOVE to remove it, the client should take steps to make
    sure that the file will still be accessible. The usual
    mechanism used is to use RENAME to rename the file from
    its old name to a new hidden name.

    Refer to General comments on filenames on page 30.
