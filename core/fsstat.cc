    union FSSTAT3res switch (nfsstat3 status) {

    };

DESCRIPTION

    Procedure FSSTAT retrieves volatile file system state
    information. On entry, the arguments in FSSTAT3args are:

    fsroot
        A file handle identifying a object in the file system.
        This is normally a file handle for a mount point for a
        file system, as originally obtained from the MOUNT
        service on the server.

    On successful return, FSSTAT3res.status is NFS3_OK and
    FSSTAT3res.resok contains:
    obj_attributes
        The attributes of the file system object specified in
        fsroot.

    tbytes
        The total size, in bytes, of the file system.

    fbytes
        The amount of free space, in bytes, in the file
        system.

    abytes
        The amount of free space, in bytes, available to the
        user identified by the authentication information in
        the RPC.  (This reflects space that is reserved by the
        file system; it does not reflect any quota system
        implemented by the server.)

    tfiles
        The total number of file slots in the file system. (On
        a UNIX server, this often corresponds to the number of
        inodes configured.)

    ffiles
        The number of free file slots in the file system.

    afiles
        The number of free file slots that are available to the
        user corresponding to the authentication information in
        the RPC.  (This reflects slots that are reserved by the
        file system; it does not reflect any quota system
        implemented by the server.)

    invarsec
        A measure of file system volatility: this is the number
        of seconds for which the file system is not expected to
        change. For a volatile, frequently updated file system,
        this will be 0. For an immutable file system, such as a
        CD-ROM, this would be the largest unsigned integer. For
        file systems that are infrequently modified, for
        example, one containing local executable programs and
        on-line documentation, a value corresponding to a few
        hours or days might be used. The client may use this as
        a hint in tuning its cache management. Note however,
        this measure is assumed to be dynamic and may change at
        any time.
    Otherwise, FSSTAT3res.status contains the error on failure
    and FSSTAT3res.resfail contains the following:

    obj_attributes
        The attributes of the file system object specified in
        fsroot.

IMPLEMENTATION

    Not all implementations can support the entire list of
    attributes. It is expected that servers will make a best
    effort at supporting all the attributes.

ERRORS

    NFS3ERR_IO
    NFS3ERR_STALE
    NFS3ERR_BADHANDLE
    NFS3ERR_SERVERFAULT
