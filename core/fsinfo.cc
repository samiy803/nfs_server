DESCRIPTION

    Procedure FSINFO retrieves nonvolatile file system state
    information and general information about the NFS version
    3 protocol server implementation. On entry, the arguments
    in FSINFO3args are:

    fsroot
        A file handle identifying a file object. Normal usage
        is to provide a file handle for a mount point for a
        file system, as originally obtained from the MOUNT
        service on the server.

    On successful return, FSINFO3res.status is NFS3_OK and
    FSINFO3res.resok contains:

    obj_attributes
        The attributes of the file system object specified in
        fsroot.

    rtmax
        The maximum size in bytes of a READ request supported
        by the server. Any READ with a number greater than
        rtmax will result in a short read of rtmax bytes or
        less.

    rtpref
        The preferred size of a READ request. This should be
        the same as rtmax unless there is a clear benefit in
        performance or efficiency.
    rtmult
        The suggested multiple for the size of a READ request.

    wtmax
        The maximum size of a WRITE request supported by the
        server.  In general, the client is limited by wtmax
        since there is no guarantee that a server can handle a
        larger write. Any WRITE with a count greater than wtmax
        will result in a short write of at most wtmax bytes.

    wtpref
        The preferred size of a WRITE request. This should be
        the same as wtmax unless there is a clear benefit in
        performance or efficiency.

    wtmult
        The suggested multiple for the size of a WRITE
        request.

    dtpref
        The preferred size of a READDIR request.

    maxfilesize
        The maximum size of a file on the file system.

    time_delta
        The server time granularity. When setting a file time
        using SETATTR, the server guarantees only to preserve
        times to this accuracy. If this is {0, 1}, the server
        can support nanosecond times, {0, 1000000} denotes
        millisecond precision, and {1, 0} indicates that times
        are accurate only to the nearest second.

    properties
        A bit mask of file system properties. The following
        values are defined:

        FSF_LINK
        If this bit is 1 (TRUE), the file system supports
        hard links.

        FSF_SYMLINK
        If this bit is 1 (TRUE), the file system supports
        symbolic links.

        FSF_HOMOGENEOUS
        If this bit is 1 (TRUE), the information returned by
        PATHCONF is identical for every file and directory
        in the file system. If it is 0 (FALSE), the client
        should retrieve PATHCONF information for each file
        and directory as required.

        FSF_CANSETTIME
        If this bit is 1 (TRUE), the server will set the
        times for a file via SETATTR if requested (to the
        accuracy indicated by time_delta). If it is 0
        (FALSE), the server cannot set times as requested.

    Otherwise, FSINFO3res.status contains the error on failure
    and FSINFO3res.resfail contains the following:

    attributes
        The attributes of the file system object specified in
        fsroot.

IMPLEMENTATION

    Not all implementations can support the entire list of
    attributes. It is expected that a server will make a best
    effort at supporting all the attributes.

    The file handle provided is expected to be the file handle
    of the file system root, as returned to the MOUNT
    operation.  Since mounts may occur anywhere within an
    exported tree, the server should expect FSINFO requests
    specifying file handles within the exported file system.
    A server may export different types of file systems with
    different attributes returned to the FSINFO call. The
    client should retrieve FSINFO information for each mount
    completed. Though a server may return different FSINFO
    information for different files within a file system,
    there is no requirement that a client obtain FSINFO
    information for other than the file handle returned at
    mount.

    The maxfilesize field determines whether a server's
    particular file system uses 32 bit sizes and offsets or 64
    bit file sizes and offsets. This may affect a client's
    processing.

    The preferred sizes for requests are nominally tied to an
    exported file system mounted by a client. A surmountable
    issue arises in that the transfer size for an NFS version
    3 protocol request is not only dependent on
    characteristics of the file system but also on
    characteristics of the network interface, particularly the
    maximum transfer unit (MTU). A server implementation can
    advertise different transfer sizes (for the fields, rtmax,
    rtpref, wtmax, wtpref, and dtpref) depending on the
    interface on which the FSINFO request is received. This is
    an implementation issue.
