SYNOPSIS

    RMDIR3res NFSPROC3_RMDIR(RMDIR3args) = 13;

    struct RMDIR3args {
        diropargs3  object;
    };

    struct RMDIR3resok {
        wcc_data    dir_wcc;
    };

    struct RMDIR3resfail {
        wcc_data    dir_wcc;
    };

    union RMDIR3res switch (nfsstat3 status) {
    case NFS3_OK:
        RMDIR3resok   resok;
    default:
        RMDIR3resfail resfail;
    };

DESCRIPTION

    Procedure RMDIR removes (deletes) a subdirectory from a
    directory. If the directory entry of the subdirectory is
    the last reference to the subdirectory, the subdirectory
    may be destroyed. On entry, the arguments in RMDIR3args
    are:

    object
        A diropargs3 structure identifying the directory entry
        to be removed:
        dir
        The file handle for the directory from which the
        subdirectory is to be removed.

        name
        The name of the subdirectory to be removed. Refer to
        General comments on filenames on page 30.

    On successful return, RMDIR3res.status is NFS3_OK and
    RMDIR3res.resok contains:

    dir_wcc
        Weak cache consistency data for the directory,
        object.dir.  For a client that requires only the
        post-RMDIR directory attributes, these can be found in
        dir_wcc.after.

    Otherwise, RMDIR3res.status contains the error on failure
    and RMDIR3res.resfail contains the following:

    dir_wcc
        Weak cache consistency data for the directory,
        object.dir.  For a client that requires only the
        post-RMDIR directory attributes, these can be found in
        dir_wcc.after. Note that even though the RMDIR failed,
        full wcc_data is returned to allow the client to
        determine whether the failing RMDIR changed the
        directory.

IMPLEMENTATION

    Note that on some servers, removal of a non-empty
    directory is disallowed.

    On some servers, the filename, ".", is illegal. These
    servers will return the error, NFS3ERR_INVAL. On some
    servers, the filename, "..", is illegal. These servers
    will return the error, NFS3ERR_EXIST. This would seem
    inconsistent, but allows these servers to comply with
    their own specific interface definitions.  Clients should
    be prepared to handle both cases.

    The client should not rely on the resources (disk space,
    directory entry, and so on.) formerly associated with the
    directory becoming immediately available.
