SYNOPSIS

    MKDIR3res NFSPROC3_MKDIR(MKDIR3args) = 9;

    struct MKDIR3args {
        diropargs3   where;
        sattr3       attributes;
    };

    struct MKDIR3resok {
        post_op_fh3   obj;
        post_op_attr  obj_attributes;
        wcc_data      dir_wcc;
    };

    struct MKDIR3resfail {
        wcc_data      dir_wcc;
    };

    union MKDIR3res switch (nfsstat3 status) {
    case NFS3_OK:
        MKDIR3resok   resok;
    default:
        MKDIR3resfail resfail;
    };
DESCRIPTION

    Procedure MKDIR creates a new subdirectory. On entry, the
    arguments in MKDIR3args are:

    where
        The location of the subdirectory to be created:

        dir
        The file handle for the directory in which the
        subdirectory is to be created.

        name
        The name that is to be associated with the created
        subdirectory. Refer to General comments on filenames
        on page 30.

    attributes
        The initial attributes for the subdirectory.

    On successful return, MKDIR3res.status is NFS3_OK and the
    results in MKDIR3res.resok are:

    obj
        The file handle for the newly created directory.

    obj_attributes
        The attributes for the newly created subdirectory.

    dir_wcc
        Weak cache consistency data for the directory,
        where.dir. For a client that requires only the
        post-MKDIR directory attributes, these can be found in
        dir_wcc.after.

    Otherwise, MKDIR3res.status contains the error on failure
    and MKDIR3res.resfail contains the following:

    dir_wcc
        Weak cache consistency data for the directory,
        where.dir. For a client that requires only the
        post-MKDIR directory attributes, these can be found in
        dir_wcc.after. Even though the MKDIR failed, full
        wcc_data is returned to allow the client to determine
        whether the failing MKDIR resulted in any change to the
        directory.
IMPLEMENTATION

    Many server implementations will not allow the filenames,
    "." or "..", to be used as targets in a MKDIR operation.
    In this case, the server should return NFS3ERR_EXIST.
    Refer to General comments on filenames on page 30.
